                Tax Audit in the UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                According to Federal Decree-Law 7 of the Tax Procedures Law,
                every taxable company is required to prepare financial records
                for an FTA tax audit. The relevant authorities shall ensure that
                the company complies with the UAE tax audit laws. The FTA’s
                official representatives examine the books and records and the
                financial statements. This is the reason why taxpayers outsource
                tax audit services in the UAE to determine the correctness of
                their tax liabilities. In addition, the FTA ensures that other
                tax obligations are met within the stipulated timeframe. Below
                we will discuss in more detail the type, procedure, and
                essential requirements of UAE tax audits for companies:

                <br />
                <br />
                VAT is an indirect tax imposed by the regulatory authorities on
                certain products and services. Under the UAE VAT laws, auditors
                are required to verify the correctness of VAT registrations, VAT
                invoices, VAT returns, and refunds. The taxable person submits a
                VAT Compliance Report in accordance with the rules of the
                Federal Tax Authority (FTA). When conducting a VAT audit in the
                UAE, the company must ensure that it collects and reports VAT
                within the prescribed time limits and complies with the VAT
                laws.

              <p>
                Excise duty is the other major type of tax in the UAE, mainly
                levied on harmful products to discourage their consumption or
                use. To ensure that your company has submitted accurate excise
                duty payments during the reporting period, you can seek
                assistance from an expert audit firm in the UAE before
                conducting a formal FTA audit.

                How does the FTA Carry out a Tax Audit in the UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The UAE requires all registered companies to be VAT compliant
                before the FTA audits their financial records. Depending on the
                Tax Procedure Law, the FTA has the right to conduct a tax audit
                of any company at any time. The FTA does not need a specific
                reason to carry out an audit. Tax audits in the UAE take place
                at the offices of the company concerned or at the option of the
                Federal Tax Authority (FTA). In accordance with Article 19 of
                the Tax Procedure Law, audits are carried out during official
                working hours and the authorities inform the companies at least
                5 days before the actual audit. The notice of the audit contains
                information such as the time, place, parties involved, specific
                reasons, etc.
                <br />
                <br />
                When conducting a tax audit in the UAE, official FTA auditors
                assess your tax liabilities and other tax-related information.
                The company’s tax agents and legal representatives can also
                assist the FTA tax auditors. The authorities have the right to
                re-audit a company if they find fraud, irregularities, and
                suspicious activity in financial records. To ensure compliance,
                companies can seek advice from certified tax advisers and
                chartered accountants in Dubai.

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">1- System Assessment</h4>
              <p>
                When companies are preparing for a tax audit in the UAE, tax
                consultants need to check their accounting system to ensure
                accuracy. They analyze in depth whether each department has the
                latest and most up-to-date accounting software to maintain data
                in the formats required by the FTA. Our team makes sure that
                every financial record and transaction complies with national
                legislation. System reviews will ensure that recorded
                transactions are consistent and correct.

                Tax assessment is required when companies prepare accounts for

                in the preparation of documentation for standard and zero-rated
                supplies of goods and services.
