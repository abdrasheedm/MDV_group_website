                the financial records to ensure accuracy and identify
                discrepancies. This is the most important part of inventory
                management and financial reporting, our team of experts can

                <br />
                <br />
                Inventory is one of the most important assets of a company. In
                the supply chain process, inventory management protects the
                company from stock-outs, controls deliveries to multiple
                locations, and keeps accurate records. Effective inventory
                management is essential for every small, medium, or large
                company. The UAE government has set authoritarian laws and
                regulations on the stock-checking process. Therefore, it is
                advisable for every company to outsource to experts in the field
                of stock audit in Dubai and save their ears from penalties for
                non-compliance.

                What is Stock/Inventory Auditing?
              </h1>
              <p>
                A stock audit can also be described as an inventory check.
                Inventory control is a routine business activity, but sometimes
                management fails to regulate proper inventory recording and
                verification in accordance with auditing laws. To overcome this
                problem, companies choose to hire professional Audit Firms in
                The UAE to prove the accuracy, maintenance, and ownership of
                inventories. The main objective of an inventory audit is to gain
                a better understanding of the current inventory records and to
                reconcile existing inventory records.

                Scope of Inventory Audit Services in Dubai
              </h1>
              <p>
                An inventory/stock audit is carried out to analyze the inventory
                levels of a company with the recorded inventory records. It
                ensures that the financial records of the stock are accurately
                maintained in the accounting software database. The company
                deals with different types of stock such as fast-moving stock,
                slow-moving stock, damaged stock, unserviceable stock, and
                obsolete stock.
                <br />
                <br />
                Therefore, once a year or twice a year, organizations should
                apply an inventory control process to properly manage the
                classification of these inventories. This is usually carried out
                by banks and financial institutions on behalf of their corporate
                customers who have used these stocks to secure loans.
                <br />
                <br />
                The stock verification process will check whether the stocks are
                expired, obsolete, or damaged. Our stock verification service in
                Dubai also ensures that both surplus and shortage stock is
                accounted for. We check your stock statistics and help
                management protect stock from damage and fraud.

                The accuracy of inventory records is also very important for a

                How Do We Carry Out a Stock Audit in The UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The stock audit process in the United Arab Emirates requires
                proper planning, experience, and knowledge of audit laws. There
                are a few key things we notice when conducting stock audits in
                Dubai and other Emirates. We prepare and assess the age,
                suitability, movement, acquisition, and market price, as well as
                the direct and indirect costs of inventories. In this way, the
                existence, accuracy and rightful ownership of the company’s
                goods are guaranteed.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our stock audit services in Dubai, UAE, ensure compliance with
                International Accounting Standard 2 for your stock check. Under
                IAS 2, inventories should be valued at a lower cost or net
                realizable value (NRV). It specifies allowable costing methods,
                including specific identification (in some cases), accounting
                for most types of stock, first-in-first-out (FIFO) accounting,
                and weighted average cost.
                <br />
                <br />
                The objective of IFRS 9 which was implemented after January 01,
                2018, is to prescribe the cost of inventories, cost formulae for
                calculating inventories, inventory accounting treatment, and
                recognition of expenses, including NRV.
