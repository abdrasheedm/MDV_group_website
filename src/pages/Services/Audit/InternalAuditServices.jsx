                An internal audit is an internal process that examines the
                operations and management of a company. It provides information
                to senior management on the effectiveness of the internal
                working system. This type of audit enables a company to closely
                monitor its internal accounting and improve the reliability of
                its financial reporting.

                Profit-making in the UAE is significant, but long-term growth
                also requires compliance with Emirati rules and regulations.
                Companies must comply with a number of tax, audit, and
                compliance laws to avoid any future penalties. If you want to
                follow standardized internal audit services in Dubai, you can
