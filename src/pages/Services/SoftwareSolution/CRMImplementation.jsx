              <p>
                CRM software provides more than just contact management. It
                drives revenue growth, productivity and customer satisfaction.
                Many companies have achieved remarkable results using a CRM
                system, but some have not achieved everything they hoped for.
                Instead, they have faced implementation challenges including
                cost overruns, integration problems, and poor user acceptance.
                The good news is that all these problems are avoidable – if the
                CRM implementation is well-designed and executed.
                <br />
                <br />
                When implemented correctly, a Customer Relationship Management
                (CRM) tool can deliver a significant return on investment by
                streamlining sales processes, improving sales processes, and
                giving employees access to more complete customer information.

                Define the specific business benefits you expect from your
                implementation project. This may seem obvious, but many projects
                fail because this step is not completed. Clarify exactly what
                you want to achieve.

              </h1>
              <p>
                CRM is driven by technology, but it is not about technology. CRM
                aims to improve customer-facing processes; technology is only a
                means to that end. Everyone involved in developing a successful
                CRM implementation plan understands this and puts structures and
                processes in place to reinforce it.
                <br />
                <br />
                Combine business and IT, but the business is the driver. CRM
                functionality is driven by business objectives that are focused
                on delivering meaningful results. If IT and LOB managers are
                aligned on well-defined measurable objectives, they can in turn
                drive CRM development.
                <br />
                <br />
                In successful CRM projects, the responsibility for system
                development and implementation lies with both the business
                sponsors and the IT staff. Business needs and requirements
                should guide configuration decisions. There is a need for shared
                responsibility, which is why in many companies the business
                project manager and the systems project manager work together to
                make functionally and technologically appropriate decisions.

              <p>
                CRM projects are strategic initiatives, so senior management
                should actively support them. Without management support,
                including an explanation of how the new system will help achieve
                business objectives, the CRM initiative may be rejected by the
                people who will need to use it. If CRM is critical to survival –
                which is increasingly the case – senior managers need to
                communicate this from the CEO down.

                Just as CRM configuration must be driven by business objectives,
                every configuration decision must support business needs. So if
                a feature doesn’t directly help you serve customers better, it
                probably isn’t needed.
                <br />
                <br />
                Each configuration must support at least one of the five
                business objectives:

                Businesses can also use CRM to extend (or even change) job
                functions where this is necessary to support a business
                objective. For example, the sales team will use CRM to better
                manage customers and sell more. But they can also use it to
                support existing customers with customer support issues, thereby
                increasing customer lifetime value.

                5-Minimise customization through local functionality
              </h1>
              <p>
                Customization is often the most expensive, time-consuming, and
                complex aspect of CRM implementation. Therefore, choosing a CRM
                application that meets your requirements can significantly
                reduce the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the
                solution.
                <br />
                <br />
                You want to avoid too exact a replication of legacy solutions.
                Instead, carefully select a CRM solution that provides the core
                functionality that meets your business needs.
                <br />
                <br />
                Before you plan to start customizing your CRM, first consider
                the application’s existing functionality. You may find that the
                core functionality supports your business requirements much
                better than anticipated, eliminating the need for costly
                customizations.

                Software consultants often boldly claim to be able to meet the
                requirements of CRM implementation. To ensure that CRM
                implementations are done on time and on budget, look for
                consultants who are thoroughly trained in the right
                implementation methodologies and have real-world experience in
                implementing these applications. How do you know that a
                potential integration partner meets these criteria? Hire someone
                who has been certified by the CRM software supplier for the
                latest version.

              <p>
                Incorporate the expertise of end-user professionals into the
                system design. If you do not solicit and take into account the
                views of users, you risk implementing a CRM that confuses and
                alienates the people it is intended to help. Once you show them
                the basic features of the solution, they will tell you exactly
                what to do with the product to help them improve their
                efficiency.

                8-Invest in CRM user training
              </h1>
              <p>
                Ensuring that CRM users are properly trained is crucial to the
                success of your implementation project. Training should not be
                overdone, nor should it focus solely on demonstrating how to use
                the software’s features. Instead, training should teach
                employees how to effectively implement the business processes
                offered by the CRM system.
                <br />
                <br />
                It should also focus on change management, given that CRM
                implementation changes the business processes of a company.
                Employees need to understand how the new processes and the CRM
                solution will help the company better serve its customers. If
                employees understand how the system will make them more
                efficient in the long term, they will readily accept it.

                9-Use a phased-in timetable
              </h1>
              <p>
                Most successful CRM projects follow a phased implementation
                schedule, focusing on a specific objective in each phase. Each
                successive phase builds on the work and lessons learned from the
                previous phases to quickly make a significant impact on the
                business.
                <br />
                <br />
                By breaking down a complex project into more manageable chunks
                that deliver ‘quick wins, the phased approach generates
                enthusiasm for the new system from the integration team to the
                CRM users.
                <br />
                <br />
                The advantage of a phased implementation is also that you can
                learn as you go. You can test new ideas in a low-risk format,
                incorporate customer feedback into the project under development
                and avoid repeating mistakes.
                <br />
                <br />
                Phased implementation should not be confused with postponement.
                Each phase of a multi-phase project should have its own strict
                timetable to keep the overall implementation project on
                schedule. Most implementation projects should complete the
                initial phase in one quarter and be fully implemented in less
                than a year. The roll-out should not exceed six to eight
                quarters and the return on investment should be visible even
                earlier.

                10-Measurement, monitoring, and tracking
              </h1>
              <p>
                Once a CRM system is operational, its effectiveness should be
                measured, monitored, and tracked in order to continuously
                improve its performance. Companies that benefit from CRM
                benchmark their processes early on. They identify the key
                performance indicators of these processes and measure the impact
                of the newly implemented CRM system on these indicators.
                <br />
                <br />
                Customer attitude and behavior surveys should also be carried
                out periodically to assess the impact of CRM on customers. Use
                an independent service for customer surveys. Outsourcing will
                not only allow specialized skills and access to industry
                benchmarks but will also increase the likelihood of obtaining
                unfiltered customer responses that are more reliable.
                <br />
                <br />
                Finally, the results of monitoring should be communicated to
                everyone involved in your CRM system.
