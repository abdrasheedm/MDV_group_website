                Accounting Software & ERP Implementation In UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                The United Arab Emirates has one of the world’s most dynamic
                economies and is a leading financial and commercial centre.
                Dubai is home to global companies establishing and expanding
                their international brands and is known as an investment hub.
                <br />
                <br />
                Despite this highly competitive economy, setting up a business
                in the UAE still requires months of preparation and planning.
                Given the strict accounting, tax, and auditing rules, an
                individual or a cooperative needs to understand company
                registration in the UAE. While the best advice is to hire a team
                of financial advisors who can efficiently handle your company’s
                books, assist you in regulatory laws, and implement the best ERP
                and accounting software in the UAE. If you are worried about
                implementing accounting software in UAE that fully meets your
                expectations, then these guidelines will surely help you.

                Accounting software versus ERP
              </h1>
              <p>
                There is a common misconception that ERP and separate accounting
                software are one and the same, but in reality, they are not. ERP
                software differs in functionality and can cover many types of
                business activities including financial management, customer
                relationship management (CRM), and supply chain management in
                one integrated system.
                <br />
                <br />
                Accounting software is the one that can only handle complex
                financial and cost operational activities and is handled by the
                finance department of the organization. It includes income
                statements, cash flows, accounts payable/receivable, general
                ledgers, and other accounting activities.

                How does Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software work?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Enterprise resource planning software is an integrated system
                designed to manage all business activities. It is used not only
                by multinational corporations but also by small businesses to
                survive in a competitive market. The ERP functionality is not
                complex as its user-friendly interface provides a 360-degree
                view of the business which improves business productivity,
                efficiency, transparency, and scalability.

                BestaxCA has partnered with leading FTA-approved accounting

                First, we research your company, and industry and thoroughly
                review the accounting solution required. This observation helps
                us to understand your financial objectives, rather than
                recommending accounting software for your organization.

              <p>
                At this stage, our consultants discuss strategy with senior
                management. In this plan, they propose an accounting solution
                with a list of any milestones, deadlines, or other
                specifications. Once the requirements are clear, our accountants
                will start preparing the necessary documentation and delivery
                date.

                transfers the data contained in the software to the latest
                accounting software. Data accounting is of paramount importance
                to any organization, so we help you move your data efficiently
                and accurately.
