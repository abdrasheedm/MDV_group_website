              </h1>
              <p>
                VAT Deregistration in UAE involves cancelling a company’s VAT
                registration with the FTA when it no longer meets the
                eligibility criteria or stops making taxable supplies. It’s
                crucial to understand this process to avoid penalties and comply
                with FTA regulations. We’ll provide guidance to help businesses
                navigate VAT Deregistration seamlessly.
                <br />
                <br />
                Business owners in the United Arab Emirates choose to cancel
                their VAT registration for many reasons. The Federal Tax
                Authority (FTA) allows a taxpayer to deactivate or cancel their
                Tax Registration Number (TRN). Cancellation of VAT registration
                in the UAE is as important as VAT registration for businesses.
                The Value Added Tax laws set out a very clear threshold and
                procedure for requesting the cancellation of VAT in the UAE.
                Here we will briefly look at all aspects related to the
                deactivation of VAT on supplies.

                What is The Deactivation of FTA VAT?
              </h1>
              <p>
                VAT deregistration in the UAE is the online process of
                suspending a company’s Tax Registration Number (TRN). A taxable
                person registered under the FTA can apply for the
                de-registration of VAT. Taxpayers can make this decision
                themselves or hire a VAT consultant in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and any
                other emirate to avoid penalties.

                A company or individual can apply for VAT deregistration in the
                UAE if it meets any of the criteria for compulsory or voluntary
                VAT deregistration. As mentioned below:

                  If the company no longer makes taxable supplies and does not
                  intend to do so in the next 12 months. In this case, they are
                  eligible to apply for VAT deregistration in the UAE.

                  registering with the FTA, it can apply for voluntary
                  deregistration from VAT.

                  A person or company applies for compulsory deregistration from

                Businesses must submit their VAT deregistration application
                within the specified tax period. If a company fails to submit a
                VAT deregistration application, it is subject to a late
                deregistration penalty of AED 1 000 for each month of delay. The
                best way to comply with all value-added tax laws is to outsource
                VAT in Dubai.

                VAT Deregistration Process In The Emirates
              </h1>
              <p>
                Due to the lack of knowledge of the UAE authorities, many
                taxpayers have questions about how to apply for the cancellation
                of their VAT registration with the FTA. However, we will guide
                you through every step of the VAT cancellation application
                process, following all the rules. Also, the authorities need to
                make sure that a winding-up letter is available before a company
                is going to apply for VAT revocation in the UAE.

                </h1>
                <p>
                  The main step is to apply on the Federal Tax Authority’s (FTA)
                  online portal. To log in, you will need to provide your
                  registered email address and password. The VAT cancellation
                  option is available in the VAT registration tab. Simply click
                  the “De-Register” button and start the process of
                  de-registering for VAT in the UAE.

                  The next step is to add all the necessary information and
                  documents to the de-registration application. The form is
                  pre-populated with basic taxable personal information. Add the
                  desired date of cancellation of the VAT registration in the
                  section from which the subject is entitled to cancel the
                  registration. Click on the Choose Files button to upload all
                  the relevant supporting documents. From the drop-down menu,

                  The final step is to review the declaration and the authorized

                Exclusion of VAT Groups From The Register

              <p>
                The right of a VAT group to deregistration in the UAE is the
                same as that of an individual taxable person or company.
                Although there are certain conditions that a VAT group must
                fulfil, such as:
                <br />
                <br />
                The authorities may approve the removal of a VAT group from the
                register if the group is no longer considered a VAT group.
                <br />
                <br />
                The taxable person may cancel the VAT registration if the group
                has no financial links with the group.
                <br />
                <br />
                The FTA may cancel the registration of a group if it anticipates
                that the taxpayer status will lead to tax evasion.
