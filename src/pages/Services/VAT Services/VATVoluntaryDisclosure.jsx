                Voluntary Disclosure of VAT In The UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) encourages individuals and
                businesses to apply VAT accurately to goods and services. If a
                company fails to comply with UAE tax laws, it is liable to pay
                heavy fines for non-compliance. However, the regulatory
                authority provides an opportunity to correct mistakes by
                submitting a UAE vat voluntary disclosure in the UAE.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is a proactive approach to inform the FTA of any error in
                tax payment or collection. Our well-qualified tax experts in
                UAEare committed to assisting businesses with filing VAT
                voluntary disclosures and protecting them from unnecessary
                penalties.

                What Is Voluntary Disclosure In VAT
              </h1>
              <p>
                UAE VAT Voluntary Disclosure is a program offered by the United
                Arab Emirates (UAE) tax authority that allows businesses to
                voluntarily report any errors or omissions in their previous VAT
                returns. This program is designed to encourage businesses to
                come forward and rectify any mistakes without the risk of facing
                penalties or legal actions.
                <br />
                <br />
                By disclosing any errors or omissions, businesses can avoid the
                consequences of non-compliance, such as fines and reputational
                damage, and maintain their credibility with customers and
                stakeholders. The UAE VAT Voluntary Disclosure program is an
                important tool for businesses to ensure compliance with VAT
                regulations and maintain good standing with the tax authority.
                <br />
                <br />A VAT voluntary disclosure is an official form provided by
                the Federal Tax Authority (FTA). It allows registered businesses
                to notify the authorities of errors, inaccuracies, and changes
                when filing a VAT return or claiming a VAT Refund in UAE. The
                taxable person must complete the “VAT211” together with all
                supporting documents within 20 working days of discovering the
                error. Here we will look at the FTA’s voluntary disclosure guide
                on filing and submission.

                Is VAT Voluntary Disclosure Required In The UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                According to the Federal Law No. 7 of 2017 on Tax Procedures, as
                well as the Cabinet Decision No. 36 of 2017 on the Enforcement
                Regulations regarding the Federal Law No. 7 on Tax Procedures,
                every registered entity is required to submit a voluntary
                disclosure to the FTA if the entity realizes that it has not
                paid the correct amount of tax.
                <br />
                <br /> The Federal Tax Authority has a team of VAT expert
                auditors who identify tax errors through tax calculations and
                tax audits. Business owners are advised to notify the
                authorities before they impose penalties for non-compliance.
                Timely submission of the VAT Voluntary Disclosure Form 211 will
                reduce the number of fines. Voluntary disclosure of VAT also
                promotes good relations with the tax authorities.

                Conditions For Voluntary Disclosure Of VAT
              </h1>
              <p>
                According to Article 8 of the Cabinet Decision No. 36 of 2017 on
                the Implementing Rules of the Federal Law No. (7) of 2017 on Tax
                Procedures, a company must submit a VAT voluntary disclosure in
                the following circumstances:
                <br />
                <br />
                1-If a person or business finds inaccuracy in its tax return or
                VAT declaration, in particular, if the tax due is less than
                required. If the amount exceeds AED 10 000, in this situation
                the company must rectify a VAT return by making a voluntary
                disclosure to the FTA.
                <br />
                <br />
                2-If a registered company detects errors in its tax assessment
                or VAT return, in particular, if the tax payable is less than
                required. Not more than AED 10 000, the company may rectify the
                error in the next VAT Return with the relevant authorities to
                correct the errors.
                <br />
                <br />
                3-Once the taxpayer becomes aware that a tax refund claim has
                been submitted incorrectly and the refund amount is higher than
                the correct amount. So the person has to notify the authority
                before the FTA collects the VAT Penalty And The Non-Compliance
                Penalty.

                How To Submit a Voluntary VAT Return In The UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                The Voluntary Disclosure Form can be submitted online via the
                VAT e-services section of the Federal Tax Authority’s website.
                The VAT Voluntary Disclosure 201 form is displayed. Simply click
                on the ‘Submit Voluntary Disclosure’ button. The form contains
                pre-populated fields with basic information on the taxable
                person and the tax period.
                <br />
                <br />
                The applicant should attach the verified supporting documents
                together with updated VAT refund/return information. The
                authorities may request additional information by e-mail. This
                is a critical process as if the taxable person does not submit a
                voluntary declaration, the authorities will not accept an appeal
                and will apply an additional penalty on top of this.
