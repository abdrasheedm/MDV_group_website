                Since 2018, Value Added Tax (VAT) has been applied to all
                taxable persons and businesses. The VAT law requires exempt or
                non-exempt entities to keep accounting records for at least 5
                years. A companyâ€™s VAT-compliant books and records are used as
                evidence during FTA audits. MDV & CO Associates has a team of certified tax
                experts in Dubai who provide the best assistance to national and
                international clients. We proficiently handle your accounting
                records and financial transactions in compliance with VAT laws.

                the UAE.

                What is VAT accounting and bookkeeping?
              </h1>
              <p>
                VAT accounting is the most important aspect of tax compliance in
                the United Arab Emirates. VAT accounting and bookkeeping include
                financial records and appropriate documentation relating to
                value-added tax. It includes in-depth reporting on the
                calculation of tax, filing of VAT returns, and collection and
                payment of VAT when due. The company should choose the best
                accounting software in the UAE that accurately produces balance
                sheets, general ledgers, invoices, credit and debit notes, etc.
                In addition, each company must keep separate records of the VAT
                collected on purchases and the VAT paid.

                The objective of VAT-compliant accounting in the UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                Accurate and up-to-date books of account are a statutory
                requirement for every taxpayer in the UAE. The main objective of
                this regulation is to ensure compliance by all small or
                medium-sized enterprises operating in the UAE. The correct
                implementation of this VAT distributes the amount of tax fairly
                among all businesses. VAT-compliant accounting allows businesses
                to file VAT returns or claim VAT refunds from the regulatory
                authorities. In addition, it will help during FTA investigations
                and protect you from penalties for VAT non-compliance.

                Types of value-added tax
              </h1>
              <p>
                There are two different types of value-added tax in the United
                Arab Emirates. An understanding of the two types is provided
                below:

              <ul className="list-decimal px-5 text-xl">
                <li className="pl-2 text-lg font-semibold">Input tax</li>
                <p className="text-base my-2">
                  Input tax is levied by an individual or a company that is a
                  registered taxpayer. It is charged when goods are purchased or
                  services are rendered to a customer. A registered business may
                  deduct the amount of tax from its payments.
                </p>
                <li className="pl-2 text-lg font-semibold">Output VAT</li>
                <p className="text-base my-2">
                  The output VAT is charged directly on the sale of goods or
                  supply of services by an undertaking. These transactions are
                  automatically calculated and a comprehensive VAT report is
                  generated by the state-of-the-art VAT accounting software AAE.

              </h1>
              <p>
                A tax-registered company in the UAE must prepare and keep
                appropriate documentation. This documentation is checked by FTA
                auditors to calculate tax and implement VAT. The following
                documents must be submitted to the UAE for VAT accounting.

              <br />
              <p>
                Taxpayers who fail to keep the records required by UAE tax law
                for at least five years are liable to VAT penalties. The fine
                for failure to keep accounts is AED 10 000 for the first offense
                and AED 50 000 for a repeat offense. All taxpayers must
                therefore comply with the VAT requirements for keeping books and
                records in the UAE. Our VAT consultants in Dubai offer all types
                of VAT services in accordance with FTA standards and do
                everything possible to avoid VAT fines and penalties.

                  VAT-compliant accounting and bookkeeping ensure that the

                  notes as required by the FTA. Company accounting records are
                  the strongest proof of your compliance with VAT regulations in

                  VAT accounting reduces the burden of tax audits by the Federal
                  Tax Authority. Proper financial records are a great help
                  during FTA accounting inspections. VAT-compliant accounting
                  confirms to the controlling authorities that the company is
                  already collecting and paying VAT. Through this database,
                  management can obtain all accurate tax-related information.

                  VAT-compliant books and records ensure that the taxable entity
                  complies with all UAE tax procedural laws. It verifies that
                  the entity complies with the rules set by the relevant
                  authorities in the UAE. Proper tracking of financial
                  transactions can reduce the risk of government administrative
                  penalties for VAT.

                  Value-added tax contributes to government revenue, which
                  ultimately stimulates the economy. This is only possible if
                  the company accurately calculates the tax on behalf of the
                  government. The purpose of VAT accounting is to calculate and
                  record the tax payments that the company will have to make to
                  the government. Accurate VAT accounting has a positive impact
