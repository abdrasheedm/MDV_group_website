              </h1>
              <p>
                In the United Arab Emirates, VAT compliance is considered a
                range of different activities in a taxable business. This
                includes VAT registration and deregistration, VAT returns,
                voluntary VAT disclosures, VAT refund, and many other
                activities. A registered business pays and collects tax on sales
                and purchases during a given tax period. Often its input VAT is
                higher than its output VAT, and the business can then claim a
                VAT refund. Our MDV & CO Associates Chartered Accountants and tax advisors
                provide excellent VAT refund services in Dubai, Sharjah, Abu
                Dhabi, Ajman, and other Emirates.

                What is a VAT refund?
              </h1>
              <p>
                VAT refunds in the UAE apply when the input tax is less than the
                output tax during the VAT return filing period. The excess tax
                is refundable to all registered businesses. The output VAT is
                the amount charged on sales and the input tax is the amount paid
                to the supplier on purchases. In such circumstances, the taxable
                person must claim the VAT back from the relevant authorities.

                Purpose of The VAT Refund
              </h1>
              <p>
                The FTA introduced a system of VAT refunds in the UAE on 1
                February 2018 in order to stabilize the national economy. VAT
                refund is a relief for taxpayers to credit the amount of
                overpaid tax. The law is being introduced to balance retail
                spending and manages account cash flows.

              <p>
                The FTA defines certain conditions and requirements for
                taxpayers to claim a VAT refund in the UAE. There are a number
                of registered entities that are subject to institutional VAT
                refunds. The following entities:

              <p>
                After submission of the application, the timeframe for the FTA
                to reply on VAT refunds in the UAE is almost 20 working days.
                However, if complex VAT refund applications take longer, the FTA
                will inform the applicant. During this period, the authorities
                will review and verify all the information provided in the
                application. Taxpayers are informed by e-mail whether the FTA
                accepts or rejects their applications. Incorrect information is
                the most common reason for the delay or rejection of
                applications. If you choose reputable VAT refund services in
                Dubai, you have a better chance of receiving your VAT refund
                without unnecessary delays.

                How do I Get a VAT Refund In The UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                If a company pays more tax than it collects from its customers,
                the taxpayer has two options for dealing with the excess VAT in
                the UAE.
                <br />
                <br />
                The first is that the taxpayer can apply for a VAT refund from
                the UAE regulatory authorities.
                <br />
                <br />
                If the taxpayer does not wish to claim a VAT refund from the
                authorities at this time, the excess input tax can be carried
                forward to future tax periods and applied as a set-off against
                the tax due or the company can appeal for a VAT refund at any
                later date.

                What is The Importance of a VAT Refund Service?
              </h1>
              <p>
                A VAT refund service can help you reclaim your VAT when you buy
                goods from another country.
                <br />
                <br />
                You have to register for VAT in the country where your business
                operates. You have to charge VAT on some or all of your invoices
                in that country, but most of the time, you need to deduct this
                tax from your receipts. However, this can be difficult for
                companies, and it can strain their cash flow. In addition, it
                will reduce your profits and investment returns, and it could
                even lead to business failure. Furthermore, if you are unable to
                refund your VAT, you may have to incur large penalties.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is important to have a valid VAT invoice before you can claim
                a refund. If your VAT invoice contains errors or omissions, you
                may not be able to claim a refund.
