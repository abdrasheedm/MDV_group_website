                complexities. Whether your business is based in Abu Dhabi,

                How to file VAT returns?
              </h1>
              <p>
                A VAT return is simply a report to the tax authorities of how
                much VAT a taxpayer has to pay or repay. A company’s net output
                tax must be paid to the relevant authorities if its output tax
                exceeds its input tax. Conversely, if the input tax of a company
                exceeds its output tax, the VAT authority must reimburse the
                excess to the company. In most cases, VAT returns are submitted
                on a quarterly basis in order to keep track of the company’s
                financial situation. <br />
                <br /> The taxable person is required to report data such as
                sales and other outputs as well as purchases and other
                investments for each tax period. VAT returns in Dubai report
                figures relating to standard, zero-rated, exempt, reverse
                charge, export and import transactions.

                Are businesses required to file VAT returns in the UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The UAE requires all taxable businesses operating on the UAE
                mainland as well as in the free zones to submit VAT returns.
                Business owners will be assigned a Tax Registration Number (TRN)
                once they have applied for VAT registration. The VAT return must
                be submitted within 28 days after the end of the tax period.
                <br />
                <br /> The VAT certificate indicates whether the business must
                submit VAT returns monthly or quarterly. All registered
                businesses submit a VAT return depending on their turnover
                according to the criteria set by the FTA. In Dubai, UAE, the
                threshold for filing a monthly VAT return is above AED 150
                million and the threshold for filing a quarterly VAT return is
                below AED 150 million. Failure to submit VAT returns on time and
                to make tax payments may result in VAT penalties.

                Why do businesses make mistakes when filing VAT returns in
                Dubai?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Many individuals and companies make mistakes when filing VAT
                returns in accordance with FTA standards. As a result, the UAE
                regulatory authorities can impose heavy VAT fines and penalties.
                There can be many reasons for this, such as a lack of knowledge
                of VAT laws, inadequate accounting systems, incorrect tax
                strategy, and errors in VAT calculations, and, last but not
                least, failure to issue valid tax invoices to counterparties. A
                company should avoid these mistakes by hiring professional VAT
                return filing services in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

              <p>
                A company registered in any Emirate will be required to submit a
                comprehensive statement of supplies made and received for each
                tax period. Knowledge and perfection are required to file VAT
                return in accordance with the UAE VAT laws and regulations. It
                is recommended to use professional VAT return filing services in
                Dubai and manage sales and other output data in accordance with
                Federal Tax Authority (FTA) standards.
