                Why businesses need company formation services
              </h1>
              <p>
                When you are starting up in a new location to set up a business
                or expand your business, it is important to use local guidelines
                to make your business a success. There is a wealth of
                information available about any country, especially the business
                environment, but understanding the nuances of the business
                culture; local government, and policies is very important when
                investing money in a foreign country. BestaxCA solves exactly
                this problem in your chosen country. We specialize in this field
                and offer turnkey solutions for setting up a business
                enterprise. Our services include a methodology that takes care
                of approvals, legal compliance, registration with authorities,
                and other necessary formalities. We have years of experience in
                providing integrated company formation services across the UAE.

                We have a strong track record in providing company formation
                services in the Middle East and the UAE in particular. Company
                formation and incorporation vary and some of the most
                sought-after locations are free zones.
                <br />
                <br />
                Free Zones in the UAE: Free zones in the UAE are highly sought
                after due to specific customs, tax, import rules, and
                regulations that are not governed by the general procedures
                applicable in the Middle East. The UAE has more than 40 free
                zones, which allow foreign investors to acquire 100% of a
                companyâ€™s shares without a local sponsor.
                <br />
                <br />
                Offshore companies in the UAE: Offshore companies are set up by
                organizations to facilitate business management. This allows the
                investor/business owner to centralize their resources and
                investments for maximum benefit. Owners of offshore companies do
                not have to pay taxes on the profits they make from owning or
                investing in property, goods, stocks, and shares.
