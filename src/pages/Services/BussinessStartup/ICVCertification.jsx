                In-Country Value – ICV Certification in UAE, UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) group companies
                introduced the ICV certification program in November 2017. The
                program was initiated by the UAE government to boost the
                country’s economic growth. The ICV Certificate in UAE, UAE,
                aims to improve the sustainability of the industrial sector by
                supporting the Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology
                (MoIAT).
                <br />
                <br />
                Later, a unified ICV program was established, bringing together
                various government and semi-government companies. ADNOC and 5
                other participating entities were merged to expand the Domestic
                Value Program in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. The provision of ICV
                certificates has been part of our consultancy expertise for many
                years. Let us look at this process in more detail:

                What Is An ICV Certificate?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The ICV Certificate in its full form is the Inland Value
                Certificate, first developed by ADNOC, the national oil company
                of the United Arab Emirates. The national ICV program is
                implemented by MoIAT to achieve optimal value from the UAE’s oil
                and gas resources. The program is expanding to cover sectors
                other than oil and gas. ICV certification bodies award UAE
                companies a value rating, which determines how much a company
                contributes to the national economy.

                The ICV certificate aims to increase the private sector’s
                contribution to the UAE’s national GDP. The ICV program
                contributes to the UAE government’s key objectives, such as:

                Are All UAE Companies Subject to ICV Certification?
              </h1>
              <p>
                ICV certification is mandatory for companies that intend to do
                business with ADNOC or its group of companies. Suppliers must
                apply to ADNOC’s designated approval organization for ICV
                certification. This must be obtained in order to be able to
                evaluate tenders and award contracts with partners. Suppliers
                benefit from ICV incentives when participating in government
                tenders. However, it is also important that different companies
                owned by the same person have separate ICV certificates. A
                single combined ICV certificate is only valid for a business
                owner if he/she has different branches in the same emirate with
                similar activities.

                Does The ICV Certificate Change The Situation of Companies?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The ADNOC ICV certificate changes the rules of the game, but it
                is directly linked to the ICV score that you obtain from the
                regulatory authorities. There is no failing on ICV – you either
                get 1% or 100%. If you get a high score, you will get high
                priority from the government when applying for tenders. To get
                this competitive advantage, you need to outsource your
                Accounting And Auditing Services in UAE, UAE, and let them
                handle the situation.

                How Do Certifying Authorities Calculate ICV?
              </h1>
              <p>
                ICV scores are calculated by a dedicated team of more than 30
                members from all certification bodies. ICV contributors include
                partners, directors, managers, senior consultants, associate
                consultants, the ICV core team, the project coordination, and
                the support team. Providers can declare their ICV certificate in
                relation to the results of the financial year. This value is
                calculated based on the total value of purchases made by the
                supplier during the year from UAE-registered suppliers. The
                valuation always varies depending on the last year’s operating
                model. As there is no specific threshold for obtaining an ICV
                certificate, each company should strive to obtain a higher ICV
                score in the country’s internal value program.

                The ICV certificate is valid for 14 months from the date of
                issue of the organization’s audited financial statements.
                Recertification of the ICV certificate may be obtained from the
                same certification body using the same audited financial
                statements during the ICV validity period. However, the validity
                of the domestic certificate of value will remain the same for 14
                months.

                The process is described below:

              <p>
                In recent years, many companies have already applied for the
                ADNOC ICV program. Unfortunately, due to the strict evaluation
                criteria of the authorities, companies obtain very low ICV
                scores. The presentation of your commercial offers and
                ICV-related documents is the most influential factor in the
                award of ICV points. The Institutions are putting in place an
                ICV improvement plan for companies wishing to achieve higher ICV
                scores than in the previous financial year.
