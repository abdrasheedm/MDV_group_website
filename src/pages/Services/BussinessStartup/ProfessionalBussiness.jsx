              <p>
                The purpose of starting and running a business has changed
                dramatically in the modern era. Businesses are looking to
                increase the value of their company and increase the value of
                their shares. Business valuation is the tipping point when an
                individual or group wants to buy, sell or transfer shares in an
                organization in the UAE. Investors, for a variety of reasons,
                need to be convinced of the correct transaction value of their
                assets. This is a complex task requiring expert advice and
                support. That is why BestaxCA offers business valuation services
                in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and across the region. Let’s get more
                information about our business valuation services:

                What is a business valuation?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Business valuation is a set of procedures to determine the
                economic value of a company or its key assets depending on the
                business model. It includes a detailed analysis of receivables,
                bonds, loans, historical financial statements, and other debt
                instruments.

                How important is it to value a company in the UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The valuation of a company is crucial for determining its net
                worth. If you are planning to restructure your company through
                acquisitions, joint ventures, or mergers, this becomes even more
                important. A higher value for your company builds the confidence
                of your suppliers, shareholders, or creditors during
                liquidation, bankruptcy, and fundraising. Knowing the true value
                of your company is as important as generating revenue.
                <br />
                <br />
                Method/approaches for determining the value of a company
                <br />
                <br />
                There are three main approaches to valuing a company, depending
                on the appropriateness of each method. As discussed below:
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">1. The income approach</h4>
              <p>
                The income approach, also known as the discounted free cash flow
                method, is an important approach used to assess the economic
                value of a company. Using this method, we determine projections
                of future cash flows and adjustments to arrive at a market value
                for the company. The DCF method is similar to the earnings
                multiplier method. In the income approach, a company’s revenues,
                expenses, and tax liabilities are valued in terms of the number
                of economic benefits it can generate for the owner or investor.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">2. The market approach</h4>
              <p>
                The market approach is the most accurate method of understanding
                the intrinsic value of an entity. We analyze comparable brand
                information in the same industry, and transactions ideally in
                the same region from last year. Using this method, business
                consultants find differences in competitors’ pricing or profit
                margins and other indicators for the company under
                consideration. As a result, it is an extremely inaccurate way of
                assessing value, as markets sometimes undervalue companies.
                Moreover, it is difficult to assess the extent to which
                individual company-specific factors influence the majority of
                the market.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">3. The cost approach</h4>
              <p>
                The cost approach, also known as the asset-based approach, is
                determined by adding together the fair market value (FMV) of a
                company’s net assets. This method provides the actual value of
                the company’s assets and the owner’s right to liquidate or sell
                the assets. This approach is generally used when a large
                proportion of the assets have significant market value.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">
                How do evaluation reports reduce risk areas?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Valuation reports contain comprehensive information and an
                assessment of the company’s main prospects. These reports
                accurately communicate the company’s current position and value
                in the domestic and international markets. Valuation reports are
                useful for investors, financial institutions, banks, and other
                entities that hold shares in a company. These valuations provide
                reliable and statistical information that enables better
                decisions to be taken. In addition, valuation reports reveal
                many areas of risk and review the various financial dimensions
                of a company.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is not a bad idea to use a third-party professional chartered
                accountant when preparing company valuation reports. Our team of
                business consultants offers financial and accounting services in
                Dubai, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Ajman and throughout the UAE.
