              <p>
                The economic substance framework applies to all companies
                licensed in the UAE to control tax evasion, whether they are
                natural or legal persons. This law is in force in almost 11
                countries worldwide.
                <br />
                <br />
                The economic substance regulations were already introduced in
                the UAE in April 2019 but were replaced by the Organization for
                Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) through the new
                Cabinet Resolution No 57 of 2020. The OECD’s main agenda is to
                control base erosion and profit-sharing practices, known as
                BEPS, and it is developing a 15-step action plan. There are at
                least 5 action plans that every OECD member country must follow,
                including harmful tax practices, also known as economic
                substance rules.

                ESR objective for the UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                The main objective of the economic substance rules is to
                regulate tax liabilities in the UAE through the relevant
                authorities. This is because many organizations, especially
                multinational corporations, save a lot of tax and take advantage
                of various low-tax jurisdictions. This amended regulation
                ensures that a company has a physical presence here and carries
                out all its business activities in the UAE, and not just a
                license that shows income in this country.

              </h1>
              <p>
                There are many significant changes in the amended economic
                substance regulations, such as certain categories of businesses
                being required to comply with the ESR law. The ESR focuses in
                particular on companies operating and generating income on the
                mainland, offshore, free zones, and financial free zones. The
                main actors in the amended framework are listed below:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-3">

                <li>Insurance business</li>

                <li>Head office</li>

                <li>Businesses exempt from ESR</li>

              <br />
              <p>
                The amended Regulations clearly define exempt licensees that do
                not meet the UAE’s economic substance test. However, they still
                submit a statement that they are exempt from the ESR, together
                with documentation. A company will be an exempt licensee if it
                is established in the UAE, carries out relevant activities and:

                In addition, the amended rules do not provide a specific
                exemption for entities that are at least 51% owned, directly or
                indirectly, by the UAE government.

                What does “qualifying substance” mean?
              </h1>
              <p>
                A qualifying substance has specific characteristics which means
                that the business activities concerned must comply with the
                notification, testing, and reporting requirements of the ESR.
                This is a key step in identifying a qualifying economic
                substance in the United Arab Emirates:

              <ul className="list-disc ml-3">

              <br />
              <p>
                Filing an economic substance regulation in the UAE is a somewhat
                complex and lengthy procedure. However, it has a positive impact
                on the UAE economy as a whole, as well as contributing to the
                growth of your business. It is an essential process to comply
                with the ESR in accordance with all relevant authorities.

              <p>
                Firstly, we need to demonstrate that the company has the
                appropriate economic substance in the United Arab Emirates. We
                must also demonstrate that Core Income Generating Activities
                (CIGA) are carried out in the country. It is then necessary to
                assess what relevant activities are carried out and whether or
                not they require the introduction of ESR in order to carry on
                business in the UAE.

                Submission of an ESR notification
              </h1>
              <p>
                A licensing company must notify the relevant authorities if it
                carries out any of these relevant activities in the UAE. The
                requirements and procedures for notifying the ESR are different

                <br />
                All companies are required to assess their ESR position and
                submit a notification to the relevant authorities. The Amended
                Resolution requires all licensees and exempt licensees to
                resubmit the ESR notification once on the Ministry of Finance
                portal. Each relevant authority has a different notification
                procedure. Some require it to be sent by email, while others
                have online portals.

                economic substance for licensees, which determines whether or
                not the company is exempt or non-exempt from the amended
