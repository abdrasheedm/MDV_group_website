                Ultimate Beneficial Ownership UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                On 28 August 2020, the UAE Cabinet adopted Resolution 58, which
                replaced Resolution 34 on 28 August 2020. This resolution aims
                to introduce corporate transparency by regulating the procedures
                of ultimate beneficial owners. The resolution also contains
                recommendations on the determination of UBOs for new and
                existing companies. The Resolution applies to all companies
                incorporated in the UAE mainland and free zones (with some
                exceptions). The Resolution emphasizes the need to establish and
                maintain a Register of Principal Beneficial Owners and
                supporting documentation. This register should be maintained by
                companies at all times. They must also provide updated
                information to the authorities and inform them of any changes to
                the register.
                <br />
                <br />
                In order to reduce the chances of corporate money fraud, both
                the State and Federal Governments issued this notification.
                Unregulated companies can engage in financial and economic
                crimes that threaten the business environment in the country.
                The UBO prevents this risk by requiring organizations and
                institutions to identify the party that will benefit from the
                activities of the entity.
                <br />
                <br />
                All legal entities need to quickly develop an understanding of
                all resolution requirements and filing processes, especially as
                obtaining and maintaining a list of beneficial owners has become
                a complex obligation. Let us start by defining the phrase
                “ultimate beneficial owner”.

                What does the term “ultimate beneficial owner” mean?
              </h1>
              <p>
                A person or organization that owns more than 25% of the shares
                and/or voting rights of a company. It is also the natural or
                legal person who benefits from any of the company’s
                transactions. A company may have a direct or indirect UBO. The
                Resolution (Cabinet Resolution 58) clearly sets out the
                application procedures to be followed by all relevant persons.

                <li>
                  According to the Resolution, a UBO is a person who directly or
                  indirectly owns and manages a company. A UBO is a person who
                  has the power to dismiss and appoint the majority of the
                  directors of the company. Persons who have control over at
                  least 25% of the shares of the company and the power to do so
                  are referred to as UBOs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If no natural person meets the above criteria, a person who
                  has control over the company in some other way should be
                  considered to be a UBO.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If no natural person can be found who meets the criteria set
                  out in paragraphs 1 to 2, the person appointed to a senior
                  management position in the undertaking shall be deemed to be
                  the UBO.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where more than one person meets the criteria for determining
                  a UBO (e.g. 25% of the voting rights are held by two persons),
                  all these persons are considered to be joint owners.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                Under the Resolution, any type of agreement may be used to
                determine the UBO of the company. This means that organizations
                can seek assistance from various legal entities and/or third
                parties. The company must always keep an up-to-date record of
                the UBO once it has been disclosed.

              <p>
                The beneficiary is not the same as UBO. The persons who are
                considered to be the beneficial owners of the company are called
                shareholders. UBOs are persons who control at least 25% of the
                equity of the company. In addition, they have the right to
                influence the company in various ways, including through direct
                or indirect control. UBOs can control the activities of entire
                organizations. It goes without saying that these people can
                wield a lot of power.

                Now that we have looked at what a UBO is and how the provisions
                of Resolution 58 work, let’s look at what legal entities in the
                UAE need to do to comply with this legislation. The Resolution
                sets out a clear set of rules that companies must follow in
                order to report their UBOs.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Resolution states that all UAE-licensed companies are
                required to disclose their UBO. The exceptions are:
              </p>
              <br />

              <br />
              <p>
                The Resolution does not require free zone licensed legal
                entities to declare their UBO. However, many financial-free
                zones already have their own procedures for identifying and
                declaring UBOs. The basic conditions for qualifying as a UBO, as
                well as the grounds for their identification, are identical to
                those set out in Resolution 58. For more information on how to
                declare UBOs in Free Zones, please contact the customer services
                of the Free Zone of your choice.

                The legal person is the ultimate beneficiary of the legal
                person’s decisions, as we have already shown. Let’s look at some
                UBO examples to help you better understand this concept:

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Example 1</h4>
              <p>
                ABC is an offshore company that has full control over 123
                FZ-LLC, a commercial company located in the UAE free zone. Mr. A
                and Mr. C each own one share in ABC (50% each). The UBO of the
                company is Mr. A and Mr. B, who are both shareholders. However,
                this does not mean that they are ABC UBO.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Example 2</h4>
              <p>
                Company XYZ is the parent company of five companies: A, B, C, D,
                and E. each of the five companies is controlled by one person.
                John owns organization A, Adam owns organization B, Sam owns
                organization C and Paul owns organization D and E. XYZ is owned
                by five companies, each of which owns half of the company. A, B,
                C, D, and E account for 20% of XYZ’s total equity. Paul owns 40%
                of XYZ because he owns companies D and E. This means that Paul
                is the UBO of XYZ.

                How to prove the ultimate beneficial owner?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The following approach should be used to identify and
                authenticate a company’s UBO:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-3">
                <li>
                  To verify that the company is legal and registered, obtain the
                  credentials of the legal entity that manages it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To find out who owns the legal entity, collect data on the
                  chain of ownership for each person who has direct or indirect
                  control over the legal entity through shares or capital stock.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Investigate the ownership share, percentage, and management
                  control of the beneficiary. This may help you to identify the
                  persons who have the most power over the company.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compare the levels of ownership and control of each NPO with
                  the conditions for identifying a UBO set out in Resolution 58.
                  The UBO will be the person who meets the criteria.

              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                Third-party assistance can simplify the UBO test. Once the UBO
                has been identified, the company should gather the necessary
                information and compile a register of beneficial owners for
                submission to the authorities.

                The procedure of identifying the UBO and then collecting
                information about it, which is then entered into the UBO
                register, starts with the declaration. According to the
                Resolution, legal persons are required to submit:

                Legal entities that comply with the Resolution are issued a UBO
                certificate. This certifies that the company has approved its
                UBO and maintains an up-to-date register of UBO information.

                <br />
                If the company ever has to deal with law enforcement authorities
                in relation to financial malpractice, a UBO certificate can be
                very useful. The certificate is issued by the licensing
                authority responsible for registering companies in the country.
