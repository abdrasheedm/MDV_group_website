                What is a backlog in accounting?
                <br />
                <br />
                Backlog accounting is the practice of recording all transactions
                from the first day of a company’s incorporation. Financial and
                accounting records must be kept and updated at the initial
                stages in accordance with regulatory guidance. The opening
                balance records show exactly where the company stands. In many
                cases, companies were not competent at the time of incorporation
                to continue to meet the backlog. Therefore, you should prepare
                in advance in case a stakeholder, business partner, or federal
                authorities ask you about your accounting history.

                Why does a company need to update its backlog accounts?
              </h1>
              <p>
                According to the UAE Companies Law, a registered entity must
                maintain and update all books and accounts since the company’s
                incorporation. Companies are required to keep records from the
                date of incorporation up to the current date. Compliance with
                the terms and conditions of the FTA is also essential to avoid
                penalties. Updating accounting records is a complex process that
                requires accounting expertise. Companies should look for a
                reputable accounting firm in the UAE to prepare their accounts.

              <p>
                The preparation of accounts receivable is very important for
                start-ups as well as SMEs in the UAE. It is more difficult for
                start-ups to comply with the requirements regarding backlog
                accounting, which may result in fines and penalties imposed by
                the authorities. The history of records helps management and
                strategists in making calculative decisions. It increases a
                company’s profit by calculating costs and reducing overheads. A
                company can remain competitive by updating non-performance
                records to avoid problems and sanctions from the authorities.
                Accountants should implement accounting software to update the
                accounts in the best way. Therefore, technological advancement
                helps business owners to analyze data as well as keep pace with
                the industrial revolution.

                1. Track the financial position of the company
              </h4>
              <p>
                Firstly, accounting information helps the business owner to keep
                track of the financial situation. Once chartered accountants
                maintain a history of the backlog of transactions, they can
                assess the contribution of each department to profit generation.
                The department with the lowest productivity is reported and
                attention is turned to the next department. This helps the
                management team to identify market trends and investment
                opportunities for the coming years. This calculated information
                benefits the organization as a whole.

                Backlog accounting saves the operator a lot of time and money.
                Proper bookkeeping helps a lot when an accountant wants to
                access an old file. The documents and information recorded in
                the accounting software are available at any time and are easy
                to retrieve. These old accounting documents are important for
                future development plans and growth opportunities. Updated
                accounting records also protect businesses from penalties during
                FTA inspections and secure your revenue.

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">3. Cash flow management</h4>
              <p>
                A clear picture of a company’s cash flow management is provided
                by the records of outstanding transactions. A thorough review of
                incoming and outgoing cash helps to forecast the financial
                position of the company. If the accounting records are properly
                updated, this will allow management to make better use of
                resources than in the past. Our accountants understand the
                importance of managing funds and other financial transactions.

              <p>
                The accounts that are prepared after the accounts have been
                finalized support the management team in decision-making in
                particular. Information on previous deadlines helps senior
                management to decide whether it is profitable to work on a new
                project or not. They can make strategic decisions and action
                plans to improve the performance of each division or unit.

              <p>
                Maintaining and updating the backlog is most useful during FTA
                tax audits. The authorities check your financial records only 5
                days in advance, so it is impossible to have the annual
                information ready in just a few days. Proper maintenance of
                backlog records is essential during an audit to avoid penalties
                and fines for non-compliance.
