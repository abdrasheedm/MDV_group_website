                What is management accounting?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Management accounting is the practice of understanding
                accounting information to develop future business strategies. It
                is a forward-looking process to determine, assess and interpret
                the financial position of a company. The purpose of management
                accounting is to analyze the financial position before any
                decision is taken.

                Management accounting versus financial accounting
              </h1>
              <p>
                The main difference between management accounting and financial
                accounting is that it is used by different business
                stakeholders. Management accounting is used for short-term
                purposes by management, shareholders, and other stakeholders.
                Financial accounting information, on the other hand, is used for
                long-term purposes by external parties of the organization.

                The role of management accounting and reporting in the UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                Under the UAE Companies Law 2015, every registered entity is
                required to keep books of account for at least five years.
                Supervisory authorities will not specifically require management
                accounts to verify the records. Although the company must
                maintain and update the information in accordance with the
                statutory requirements. Strategists, therefore, pay particular
                attention to reporting management accounts to resolve problems.
                The report includes all information on employee productivity,
                departmental performance, information on suppliers and
                customers, etc. This will help the management to monitor the
                internal operations as well as the finances of the company.
