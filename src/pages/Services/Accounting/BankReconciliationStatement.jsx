              <p>
                Every organization, regardless of its size, conducts its
                financial transactions manually and through digital banking.
                Banking is one of the key elements of any financial transaction.
                Businesses conduct thousands of transactions every day and
                keeping track of each of them is quite complex. The accuracy and
                compliance of bank accounts are the most worrying factor for
                businesses. Our chartered accountants offer quality bank
                reconciliation reporting services across the Emirates. Let’s
                find out more about what we do!

                What Is Bank Reconciliation?
              </h1>
              <p>
                A bank reconciliation statement is a comparative analysis to
                find out the difference between a bank’s cash book and a
                company’s balance sheet. It can be used to reconcile financial
                records to bank accounts and provide an overview of the bank’s
                activities. A bank statement is a list of deposits, withdrawals,
                and other activities for a specified period. Regular
                reconciliation of bank accounts is imperative as we cannot rely
                on banks alone. It is a great way to detect errors or fraud
                before it causes damage to your business.

                The Purpose Of Account Reconciliation
              </h1>
              <p>
                The main purpose of reconciliation is to prevent omissions in a
                company’s bank account. Businesses cannot rely blindly on the
                functionality of banks. Account reconciliation is therefore
                carried out to detect errors and fraud in cash accounting. In
                this way, accountants can prevent organizations from facing
                significant losses in the future.

                Is Bank Reconciliation Mandatory In UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Bank reconciliation is not compulsory for companies, although it
                is not unimportant in the UAE. There is no set date or timeframe
                for the preparation of a Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS).
                This analysis of bank accounts in companies is carried out
                periodically. Any adjustments or corrections can be made during
                the reconciliation process.

                <b>Bank reconciliation process in the Emirates</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                There are some basic steps for conducting a bank reconciliation
                in the UAE. Our accountants follow the following procedure to
                detect and prevent suspicious activity in the accounting
                records.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">
                1. Collate bank and company documents
              </h4>
              <p>
                The main step is to collect all bank and organization records.
                The business owner is allowed access to the reconciling
                accountant to review all transactions made by the person or
                organization. Banking institutions provide a detailed overview
                of daily financial transactions. You must then compile the
                business records that the business maintains on its side. Our
                chartered accountants in UAE will analyze both the similarities
                and differences in the accounts to start the reconciliation
                process.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">
                2. Determine the duration of the reconciliation
              </h4>
              <p>
                The next step is to determine the duration of the bank statement
                reconciliation. It is really important to establish a starting
                point. If you reconcile the bank and company records by
                accident, it will do nothing. It is therefore advisable to start
                the process from where you left off last time.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">
                3. Assess bank deposits and cash withdrawals
              </h4>
              <p>
                This is a very critical point at which the accountant needs to
                review the bank deposits and cash withdrawals from the company
                account. We will check the amounts added and withdrawn as
                mentioned in the bank cash book and company documents. Make sure
                that the amounts shown in the company’s documents match the
                amounts shown in the bank statement. In addition, if you notice
                an error in either of the two documents, make sure that the
                error has been corrected and also raise it with the banking
                authorities.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">
                4. Check income and expenditure
              </h4>
              <p>
                Checking the company’s income and expenses is not an ignored
                part of the bank reconciliation statement. Many companies make
                payments in cash and do not record them in the cashbook, which
                creates problems for the future. The accountant should record
                all expenses in the bank and company accounts.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">
                5. Regulate bank statements
              </h4>
              <p>
                After recording all expenses and receipts, the next task is to
                organize the bank statements. In this part of the reconciliation
                process, the accountant has to deduct outstanding cheques, add
                transit deposits or delete errors in entries. This will adjust
                the bank statements and eliminate any errors or discrepancies.
              </p>
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">6. Adjust cash balance</h4>
              <p>
                Equally important is the reconciliation of the company’s cash
                statement and cash balance. The reconciliation accountant needs
                to identify invoices and payments, insufficient funds, deduct
                monthly expenses and obtain receivables. All this is essential
                to adjust the cash balance.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">
                7. Reconcile the final balance sheet
              </h4>
              <p>
                Once the cash balance and the bank statement have been adjusted,
                the accountant moves on to the next and final stage of the
                reconciliation process. At this point, the accountant makes sure
                that the final balance in the bank and in the company’s
                documents must be the same. The company can then prepare journal
                entries to ensure proper control within the company. If the
                account is not managed properly, balance sheet losses may occur.
                Our chartered accountant will reconcile your final balance and
                repeat the reconciliation process until the balance is equal.

                Why do you need to reconcile your bank account often?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The frequency of bank reconciliation statements depends entirely
                on the business owner. Reconciliations can be done daily,
                weekly, or monthly. Small businesses generally prefer weekly or
                monthly bank reconciliations. While large companies reconcile
                accounts each time they receive a bank statement or at the end
                of each day.
