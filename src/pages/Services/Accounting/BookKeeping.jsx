              </h1>
              <p>
                Bookkeeping and Accounting services in UAEplay an important
                role in every industry to record financial transactions,
                payroll, taxes, invoices and more. There is very little
                difference between accounting and bookkeeping services, but both
                share the common goal of developing the financial cycle at
                different stages.
                <br />
                <br />
                This day-to-day accounting firm helps to manage income and
                expenditure in a cost-effective way. However, it has become
                difficult for ordinary accountants to implement International
                Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) perfectly. The solution is
                to outsource these expert services to achieve long-term goals.
                MDV & CO ASSOCIATES Chartered Accountant is regarded as one of the leading
                accounting and bookkeeping firms in UAE, with a team of highly
                qualified financial advisors to help you with complex projects.

                Accounting & Bookkeeping Are Mandatory Laws in The UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                In the United Arab Emirates, regulatory compliance is increasing
                by the day and no business owner wants to incur hefty fines for
                breaking the law. According to the UAE Commercial Companies Law,
                every small or large company in UAEmust comply with IFRS and
                IAS requirements to perfectly manage its financial affairs. In
                addition, companies are obliged to keep adequate accounting
                records for at least five years until the end of the financial
                year. This is also required by the Federal Tax Authority and
                other government authorities.
                <br />
                <br />
                Companies, therefore, need expert accounting and bookkeeping
                services that provide guidance on how to comply with local and
                international laws, as well as protect them from administrative
                penalties. Spending on accounting and bookkeeping services is an
                investment that pays for itself in years to come.

                How Do Accounting And Bookkeeping help With Your Cash Flow
                Statements?
              </h1>
              <p>
                A bookkeeper offering accounting and bookkeeping services is an
                essential component of any business, and their job is to oversee
                cash flow. They use software and Record-Keeping systems to
                ensure that all transactions are recorded properly, and they
                check payments and accounts for accuracy. This helps to minimize
                manual labour and increase productivity. In addition, they will
                keep an eye on every dollar that comes into the business and
                leaves it, so you don’t have to.
                <br />
                <br />
                Most bookkeepers offering accounting bookkeeping services
                prepare three major financial statements: the profit and loss
                statement and the balance sheet. Cash flow is a measurement of
                how much cash you have available and how much money you need to
                meet expenses. Bookkeeping software can help you prepare these
                financial statements and share them with your tax preparer or
                accountant.
                <br />
                With bookkeeping services, your accountant will be able to view
                and analyze financial records in an organized manner. The
                bookkeeper will keep the Chart of Accounts, General Ledger, and
                journal up to date and provide you with regular statements.
                Bookkeeping services also help you manage cash flow and maximize
                your tax deductions.

                How To Determine Financial Transactions?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Accounting services work to determine financial transactions and
                other information for a company. This includes preparing the
                balance sheet, a document that lists the assets, liabilities,
                and capital of a business. Experienced accountants use
                standardized UAEaccounting formulas to create these
                documents. Assets are things that a company owns, and
                liabilities are items that it owes. Owner’s equity, on the other
                hand, represents the amount of money that an owner has invested
                in the business.
