              <p>
                The Government has always been committed to making UAE companies
                world economic leaders. It makes changes to working models,
                reporting requirements, tax systems and record-keeping according
                to local and international needs. In this context, the UAE
                authorities are setting new financial reporting standards for
                corporate accounting. Using new approaches, we provide expert
                IFRS implementation and advisory services in the UAE.

              <p>
                IFRS are International Financial Reporting Standards, the
                globally recognized reporting language. Almost 90 countries have
                confirmed that they apply International Accounting Standards,
                although around 120 countries are required to adopt IFRS. This
                reporting requirement has a direct impact on a company’s
                financial statements and balance sheet. The introduction of IFRS
                will facilitate the expansion of UAE companies into national and
                international markets.

                IFRS rules in the UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                Under the UAE’s Commercial Companies Law No. 2 of 2015,
                companies are required to apply international accounting
                standards. There are now no national generally accepted
                accounting standards in the UAE. Every registered company is
                required to practice internationally accepted accounting
                practices in its financial reporting. IFRS are mandatory for
                local public companies, SMEs and listed foreign companies in all
                UAE Emirates. Therefore, compliance with IFRS reporting
                requirements can avoid fines and penalties from the relevant
                authorities.

                The implementation of IFRS has become essential to ensure
                compliance with domestic and international reporting standards.
                It is a globally understood language that ensures transparency
                and economic efficiency in business reporting. IFRS is essential

                Why do companies need IFRS implementation consultants?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Because there is a large worldwide checklist to ensure
                compliance with international reporting standards. All IFRS
                require skillful implementation of the standard without errors.
                Therefore, ordinary accountants often fail in this process and
                make many mistakes in the preparation of both the balance sheet
                and the income statement. This leads to penalties and damages
                the company’s reputation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Expert accountants and consultants are needed to implement IFRS,
                which provides a protective shield for UAE companies. They are
                skilled in how to enter and calculate accounting and financial
                transactions in accordance with International Financial
                Reporting Standards (IFRS). This scenario fits perfectly with
                the work of our chartered accountants, who provide accounting
                and bookkeeping services to both local and international
                clients. We ensure that your accounting records comply with the
                latest international guidelines.

              <p>What are the benefits of adopting IFRS?</p>
            </div>
            <h4>1. Error manipulation in financial statements</h4>
            <p>
              Accountants check the accuracy of your financial statements by
              identifying errors, miscalculations and inappropriate estimates.
              The introduction of IFRS helps to close gaps and identify areas of
              non-compliance with international reporting standards. It also
              provides economic efficiency by giving investors a broader view of
              opportunities and risks around the world.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Increase global transparency</h4>
            <p>
              UAE companies need to partner with multinational corporations to
              grow. Therefore, the adoption of IFRS is mandatory to present
              financial statements in the same internationally recognized
              language. This will increase comparability to make relevant
              economic decisions.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Assisting management in decision-making</h4>
            <p>
              The implementation of IFRS provides management with a statistical
              overview for decision-making. Accurate financial statements are
              very helpful in developing future strategies and policies to
              ensure the profitability of the business.
