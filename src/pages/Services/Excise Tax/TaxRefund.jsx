                Get Excise Tax Refund In UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                For companies operating in the UAE, it is always important to
                comply with the country’s tax laws. In the UAE, there are two
                main types of taxes that must be collected to comply with the
                requirements of the federal tax authority. The first is VAT, a
                value-added tax applied at every stage of the supply chain,
                while excise duties are only levied during the production and
                importation of goods. If a company deals in excisable goods, it
                must effectively manage the filing of the excise tax return as
                well as the reimbursement of excise tax in the UAE upon
                registration. Here we will look in detail at the process of
                obtaining an excise duty refund from the UAE regulatory
                authorities.

                What is an excise duty refund?
              </h1>
              <p>
                An excise duty drawback applies when the excise duty to be
                deducted is higher than the excise duty payable as declared. The
                Federal Tax Authority is responsible for refunding the amount of
                overpaid tax in accordance with the provisions of the Excise
                Duty Law. A registered economic operator may claim a refund of
                excise duty by submitting an application to the FTA.

                Reason for claiming a refund
              </h1>
              <p>
                The main reason for a refund of excise duty is to provide
                financial relief to manufacturers, importers, and warehouse
                keepers. They can use the excess refundable tax to deduct from
                their excise duty liability payable to the FTA in subsequent tax
                periods until the excess refundable tax is utilized. The request
                is necessary to obtain the excess refundable tax and to balance
                the tax assessments. This has a full impact on your company’s
                revenue and growth in the years to come.

                When to claim a refund of excise duty from the FTA?
              </h1>
              <p>
                According to the Federal Law No. (7) Of 2017 on Tax Procedures,
                registered companies can claim a refund of excise duty from the
                FTA if the following conditions are met:

              <ul className="list-disc ml-3">
                <li>
                  If excise duty was previously paid on an excisable good that
                  has also been transformed into another new excisable good and
                  excise duty is again payable on it. For example, excise duty
                  is payable on both raw tobacco and cigarettes made from
                  tobacco.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the excisable good is already taxed in the UAE and exported
                  outside the country.

                Excise duty refund periods
              </h1>
              <p>
                The time taken to check and accept an excise duty drawback claim
                is usually time-consuming, as excise goods are subject to high
                charges. The FTA will refund the excess refundable tax to the
                taxpayer within almost 2 calendar months of the request. The FTA
                also has the right to carry out a tax audit to check your case
                within 21 calendar days. In certain situations, the FTA may
                refund an overpayment of refundable tax in less than two tax
                periods. The first of these is when the excise duty registration
                is canceled. The second is where the FTA is satisfied that the
                taxpayer is likely to carry out taxable activities in the
                future, but there is a likelihood that a refundable overpayment
                will have accumulated for at least one year.

                How can I claim a refund of excise duty in the UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Refunds of excise duty in the UAE are made online via the FTA’s
                official website. Let’s take a look at some of the important
                steps to claim an excise duty refund:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul className="px-5 text-xl">
                <li className="text-lg font-semibold">
                  Step 1: Log in to your FTA portal
                </li>
                <p className="text-base my-2">
                  First, the applicant must log in to the FTA e-services portal
                  using the registered email address and password. Once this is
                  done, he/she has to click on the “Excise Duty” tab.
                </p>
                <li className="text-lg font-semibold">
                  Step 2: Access the refund form
                </li>
                <p className="text-base my-2">
                  To access the Repayment Form, the applicant or representative
                  clicks on the ‘Excise Declarations and Repayment of Excise
                  Duty’ tab. Then scroll down and open the form “EX301 – Excise
                  duty refund”.

                <li className="text-lg font-semibold">
                  Step 3: Add information in the fields
                </li>
                <p className="text-base my-2">
                  Here begins the real process of filling in all the mandatory
                  fields and attaching the necessary documents. Once you have
                  completed the form, click on the “Save and Review” button and
                  confirm the details.
                </p>
                <li className="text-lg font-semibold">
                  Step 4: Submit the application
                </li>
                <p className="text-base my-2">
                  It is important to review all information before submitting
                  your application. If the information you have entered is
                  accurate, click the “Submit” button. Your request is now
                  forwarded to the federal authority.

                <li className="text-lg font-semibold">

                <p className="text-base my-2">
                  After you receive the email confirming your refund, you can
                  access the “My Payment” section under “Transaction History” to
                  view your balance.

                However, this process is not as simple as it seems. Applicants
                are required to submit their refund applications in a timely and
                accurate manner. Businesses can be penalized for late or
                incorrect submission of tax refund claims.

              <p>
                Taxpayers often get confused when paying their taxes and end up
                paying more than they are supposed to. They do not understand
                the FTA rules and the complex tax regimes in the UAE. As a
                result, companies face compliance problems and heavy fines and
                penalties from the authorities. For the taxpayer, the process is
                time-consuming and complicated. Taxpayers are advised to
                outsource to professional tax advisors in UAEwho will prevent
                your accounting from FTA penalties.
