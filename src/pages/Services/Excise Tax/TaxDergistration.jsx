                Excise Tax Deregistration In UAE.
              </h1>
              <p>
                The excise duty was announced in October 2017 to control the
                harmful effects of certain goods or items produced in the United
                Arab Emirates. These products include energy and sweetened
                drinks, alcohol and cigarette consumption, as well as many other
                products that have a negative impact on human health and the
                environment. For this reason, the national government made it
                compulsory for companies to register for excise duty in the UAE.
                However, if a company is no longer in the business of excisable
                goods, it is also obligatory to apply for cancellation of the
                excise duty registration in the UAE.

                What is deregistration?
              </h1>
              <p>
                De-registration for excise duty is an online form submitted via
                the Federal Tax Authority’s (FTA) online portal. It is requested
                when a company is no longer responsible for excisable goods and
                wishes to cancel its excise duty registration in the UAE. The
                cancellation of excise duty registration in the UAE is carried
                out in accordance with the tax law.

              <p>
                There are certain circumstances in which a registered person
                must request cancellation of excise duty registration in the
                UAE. The tax authority has clearly stated the conditions for
                cancellation of excise duty registration, such as:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-3">
                <li>
                  If the registered person ceases taxable activities such as the
                  manufacture, import, and storage of excisable goods and does
                  not intend to deal in those goods for a further 12-month
                  period (1 year). Then the person must file a cancellation of
                  excise duty registration in the United Arab Emirates.

                  right to make the cancellation of excise duty registration in
                  the UAE compulsory.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If an applicant for excise duty registration requests
                  cancellation of registration, the registrant must cancel the
                  tax warehouse licenses held prior to the request.

                days of the occurrence of any of the above situations. The tax
