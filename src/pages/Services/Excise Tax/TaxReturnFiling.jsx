                Excise Tax Return Filing Services In Dubai
              </h1>
              <p>
                The excise duty on taxable units was introduced in October 2017
                in the United Arab Emirates. The main objective is to control
                the consumption of excisable goods and their harmful effects on
                health. A person dealing in certain categories of goods is
                required to register for excise duty. Therefore, according to
                the tax laws and regulations, the subject is also required to
                submit an accurate excise duty declaration filed in the UAE.
                MDV & CO Associates provides excellent services to ensure that the tax
                return is submitted on time and with the least chance of error.
                We understand and implement all the legal provisions required
                for filing tax returns in the UAE:

              </h1>
              <p>
                Filing an excise duty return means recording the amount of
                excise duty paid at the end of each tax period. The submission
                of the forms is done entirely online via the official FTA
                portal, as manual submissions are no longer acceptable. The
                excise declaration form is available in both languages (English
                or Arabic) and the applicant may choose one or both of them. Our
                consultants are fluent in both languages and offer excise duty
                declaration services to both domestic and international clients.

                When do I need to submit my excise declarations in the UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The Executive Decree of the Excise Tax Law stipulates that when
                taxable entities obtain an excise tax registration, they are
                required to file excise tax returns periodically in the UAE.
                These must be submitted within 15 days after the end of each tax
                period. The tax period is generally referred to as one calendar
                month. Excise duties must be submitted and paid within this time
                limit in accordance with the Tax Procedures Law in order to
                avoid FTA penalties.

                Consequences of late submission of the excise duty return
              </h1>
              <p>
                Filing a UAE excise duty declaration is a very important
                procedure as it is the official way of reporting excisable goods
                that are manufactured, imported, and stored. Penalties may be
                imposed by the Federal Tax Authority on a company that fails to
                file excise declarations or fails to file them at all. This
                scenario could best be addressed by tax consultants in the UAE
                who will file excise declarations within the prescribed time
                even if the excise duty has already been paid.

                The taxpayer is obliged to pay the tax due on the same date as
                the tax return is filed. The duty payable must be paid when
                importing excisable goods.
