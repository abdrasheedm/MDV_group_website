                Excise Stock Audit In UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                The Excise Duty Act entered into force on 1 October 2017
                pursuant to Federal Decree-Law No. (7) Of 2017. It is an
                indirect tax levied on certain excisable goods manufactured,
                produced, and stored in the United Arab Emirates. The
                supervisory authorities will verify the adequacy of the excise
                duty records of each taxable entity through tax audits or
                inspections. Therefore, small and medium-sized enterprises
                should take care to comply with the stock record-keeping
                requirements of the Excise Duty Law.

                In order to manage inventories effectively, business owners
                always prefer to audit excise inventories in the UAE. This is
                the best way to ensure the accuracy of the tax records of the
                physical stock of the company.

                What does a stock audit mean?
              </h1>
              <p>
                A stock audit is carried out to check the physical stock
                available in a warehouse against the stock recorded in the books
                of account and to find similarities or discrepancies. It is
                carried out to verify the quantity and condition of goods held
                in stock in the factory. This helps to monitor and protect
                stock, which is the company’s biggest asset. The audit of excise
                stocks can also reduce the risk of theft, damage, stock expiry,
                and product end-of-life.

                Why is an excise audit so important in the Emirates?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Stock audits are essential for companies dealing with excisable
                goods in any emirate of the UAE. This is because inventories are
                key assets of an organization and have a direct impact on the
                profit and loss accounts. Any ambiguities or miscalculations in
                the inventory records lead the company to losses. In addition,
                the FTA may impose severe penalties for failure to maintain
                stock records in accordance with regulatory requirements.
                <br />
                <br />
                Therefore, the company must keep accurate stock or inventory
                records. You can hire our tax consultants for any excise
                services in UAE, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, and other Emirates, which
                will protect your company’s account from potential risks and
                penalties.

                Purpose of the excise inventory control
              </h1>
              <p>
                The audit of excise inventories is also known as stock
                verification in the UAE and its main purpose is to monitor the
                compliance of inventory records with tax laws. It ensures the
                accuracy, existence, and value of stocks held in the company’s
                warehouses or factories. It is ideal for developing stock
                management strategies, for example, to identify surplus or
                shortages of stock according to their lead time. Inventory
                verification will therefore help individuals and businesses to
                monitor their stocks and make a profit. Some other objectives of
                stock verification are mentioned below:

                Why do companies hire external auditors to audit excise stocks?
              </h1>

              <p>
                The Federal Tax Authority requires stock audit reports during
                the financial records check. Excise stock reports must also be
                prepared by authorized and certified tax auditors. For this
                reason, conducting an excise stock audit in the UAE requires
                expertise and adequate knowledge of tax laws and resources. In
                order to track the entry and exit of excisable goods, the
                operator must hire third-party external auditors to audit the
                stocks in accordance with FTA standards. The auditors can assess
                the accuracy of the physical stock with transitional stock. They
                also assist in the preparation of the excise stock report in
                accordance with the FTA’s new excise stockholding requirements.
