                Excise Tax Penalty Reconsideration In UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                In the United Arab Emirates, excise duty is levied only on
                certain goods that are manufactured, imported, and stored. The
                Federal Tax Authority supervises the application of excise duty
                on the basis of the current tax procedure law. Taxpayers who do
                not comply with the UAE excise duty laws and regulations are
                penalized. However, the FTA provides for the possibility to
                apply for a review of the excise duty penalty if the taxpayer is
                not satisfied with the authority’s decision. This is a complex
                process, so our tax experts in Dubai can guide you through the
                review procedure in accordance with the FTA guidelines.

                Importance of excise duty in the Emirates
              </h1>
              <p>
                Excise duty is compulsory in all Emirates of the UAE as it aims
                to reduce the harmful effects of certain excisable goods. An
                organization that sells carbonated beverages, alcohol,
                e-cigarettes, petroleum products, etc. must implement excise
                duty in order to properly market excisable goods. This will also
                reduce the likelihood of the entities being subject to FTA
                administrative penalties.
                <br />
                <br />
                The UAE regulatory authorities can assess the excise duty
                records of registered companies. If a company has not complied
                with FTA requirements within the time limits and has underpaid
                excise duties, the authorities may impose heavy fines.
                Therefore, every taxable company in the UAE pays attention to
                excise duty.

                Excise duty penalties in the UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                Under Federal Decree-Law No. (7) Of 2017 on Excise Duty, the FTA
                imposes administrative penalties on taxpayers for violations of
                tax laws and regulations. Regulatory penalties may result from
                the following scenarios:
              </p>
              <br />
              <ul className="list-disc ml-3">
                <li>
                  If the taxpayer does not indicate the prices that include the
                  tax, an administrative penalty of AED 15 000 is imposed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the taxpayer fails to comply with the conditions related to
                  the movement of excise goods from one designated zone to
                  another and fails to comply with the legal procedures for the
                  production and storage of excise goods. A fine of AED (50 000)
                  or more is imposed. (50% of the tax, if any, applicable to the
                  goods as a result of the offense).
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Taxable Person fails to submit price lists to the FTA
                  for the excise goods manufactured, imported, or stockpiled
                  therein. The fine is AED 5,000 the first time and AED 20,000
                  in case of repeated acts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you fail to register as an excise taxpayer within the
                  prescribed time limit, you will be fined AED 20 000.

              <p className="font-semibold">
                In case of non-compliance with the excise duty, the taxpayer may
                review the decision of the authority in accordance with Federal
                Decree-Law No. 7. A person may waive the non-compliance penalty
                by submitting a UAE excise duty review form to the FTA, if
                applicable, however, comprehensive knowledge of the tax laws and
                experience in this procedure is required. Our tax advisors can

                The UAE Excise Penalty Review Form is only available on the
                official website of the Federal Tax Authority. The applicant has
                to log in to his e-service account using the registered email
                address and password. The form consists of pre-populated fields
                requiring updated and correct information along with supporting
                documents. The applicant is required to provide the authorities
                with an explanation for the non-reconciliation of the excise
                duty penalty (why you are not satisfied with the FTA’s
                decision). Also, communicate alternative actions that should be
                taken in your case. One of the most important things is that the
                application and all evidence must be in Arabic and not in
                English, in accordance with the FTA guidelines. You can
                outsource to tax experts in Dubai who help national or
                international clients deal with administrative penalties with
                the least likelihood of error.

                How does the FTA reduce fines for tax infringements?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The Federal Tax Authority strives to create a safe and friendly
                business environment for UAE residents and foreigners. The FTA
                does not necessarily impose penalties for non-compliance, but
                also offers additional ways for businesses to avoid them. As
                mentioned above, applying for an excise duty penalty review
                helps a number of taxpayers to reduce their penalties. However,
                the FTA recently announced a major relief for taxpayers – a
                review of administrative penalties in the UAE to reduce the
                penalties imposed on them. Under this recently amended
                provision, taxpayers whose outstanding penalties were not paid
                by 31 December 2021 could have them reassessed by 31 December
                2022.
