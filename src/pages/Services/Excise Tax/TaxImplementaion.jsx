              <p>
                In October 2017, the United Arab Emirates announced for the
                first time an excise duty on certain goods. It applies to more
                than 1 700 goods that are harmful to the environment or human
                health. These goods include energy or carbonated drinks,
                electronic smoking devices, alcohol, tobacco, and other related
                products.
                <br />
                <br />
                Every company dealing in these types of goods must comply with
                the excise duty requirements under the Tax Procedures Act. The
                UAE tax regime is amended from time to time in line with the
                latest business requirements. Our tax consultancy services will
                provide you with professional excise duty implementation and
                training in the UAE to facilitate your compliance with FTA tax
                rules and guidelines.

                Scope of excise duty in the UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                The introduction of excise duty in the UAE is not only a means
                of generating revenue for the government but also aims at
                reducing the consumption of unhealthy products. Regulators have
                a duty to reduce the availability of harmful products on the
                market. This initiative was implemented to indirectly control
                the health problems of the population and to promote healthy
                lifestyles throughout the Emirates. All organizations are
                therefore required to comply with excise duty in the UAE and
                ensure that their corporate social responsibilities are met.

                At each stage of the excise duty implementation, the FTA
                requires a number of documents and related information in order
                to examine your excise duty claim. These documents must be free
                of errors and verified to ensure that operators are not

                consultants will review all documents related to excise goods
