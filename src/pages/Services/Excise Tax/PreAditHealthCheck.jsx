                Excise Tax Pre-Audit Health Check-In UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                Since 2017, the United Arab Emirates has introduced excise
                duties on certain types of goods. All registered entities are
                required under the FTA to check whether their excisable goods
                are taxable, to file an excise duty return on a monthly basis,
                and to comply with other tax obligations. This is important to
                remember as the authorities can call you whenever they want to
                carry out an excise duty audit. If FTA auditors find
                non-compliance, the taxpayer can be fined heavily. That is why
                our tax consultants in UAEwill provide you with a
                professional excise duty pre-audit health check service. By
                taking these precautions, companies can avoid FTA penalties in
                the future.

              <p>
                An excise audit is a review and verification of a registered
                legal entity’s tax compliance. It is carried out to verify that
                the taxpayer’s excise tax liability is accurate and has been
                duly paid within a specified period of time.

                Who will carry out a tax audit in the UAE?
              </h1>
              <p>
                According to the provisions of Decree-Law 13 of 2016, the
                Federal Tax Authority is responsible for the collection of taxes
                in the UAE for a given tax period. The FTA is the country’s
                official regulatory authority that can conduct VAT/excise tax
                audits to analyze companies’ operations and tax compliance.

                How does the FTA decide whether to carry out an excise audit?
              </h1>
              <p>
                The Federal Tax Authority identifies companies for excise tax
                audits, but there are no specific criteria. It is entirely the
                FTA’s decision as to what will be audited and at what intervals.
                They can inspect a taxable business entity at any place or at
                any time for a formal tax audit. The relevant authority will
                normally take action against a company if it suspects that there
                is any risk, error, or tax evasion in the accounts.
                <br />
                <br />
                The FTA sends five days’ notice to the taxable business of the
                excise duty inspection. Although in cases where tax evasion is
                suspected, auditors pay a surprise visit to the company. They
                usually fix the place and time of the excise duty inspection in
                the UAE. It is recommended that your legal representative is
                present to assist the FTA auditors throughout the procedure. The
                auditors may ask you to provide original or copies of excise
                documents. The inspection is mostly carried out on working days.
                They may also carry out a re-audit if the company fails to meet
                its tax obligations in the first round under the UAE Excise
                Procedure Law.

                Why is a pre-audit tax health check important?
              </h1>
              <p>
                A pre-audit health check is important for all taxable companies
                operating in the United Arab Emirates. This pre-assessment
                analyses potential tax issues identifies areas of non-compliance
                with excise duty requirements and identifies business
                uncertainties. Your excise records should be corrected before
                the auditor examines them to eliminate errors or omissions.
                Otherwise, the UAE regulatory authorities will penalize your
                business account. We will conduct a pre-audit assessment of your
                excise records to eliminate any potential errors.
