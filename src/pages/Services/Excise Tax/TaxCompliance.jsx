                Excise Tax Compliance Service In UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                Excise duty is levied on taxable persons who sell certain types
                of goods that are harmful to the environment or to human health.
                These companies have to comply with the UAE excise duty laws,
                which include registration, filing of declarations, voluntary
                disclosures, and many others. However, the Federal Tax Authority
                is always updating new reporting requirements on excise duty
                compliance in the UAE. For this reason, companies recognize the
                importance of the perfect implementation of excise duty laws and
                regulations. Our tax consultants in Dubai will help you adapt to
                the changing FTA regulatory landscape.

                Excise duty law in the UAE
              </h1>
              <p>
                According to Federal Decree-Law No. 7 of 2017, companies are
                required to register if they deal in excisable goods in any
                emirate. This includes electronic smoking devices, tobacco,
                carbonated beverages, energy drinks, etc. Under the FTA, all
                taxable entities are obliged to comply with the excise duty
                regime in the UAE. The government is constantly updating the tax
                laws to stay one step ahead. To comply with UAE tax rules, FTA
                auditors will check the accuracy and compliance of your excise
                tax records at any time.

                What does excise compliance mean?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Excise compliance simply means ensuring that your excise records
                comply with your local tax obligations. The Federal Tax
                Authority is responsible for the collection and assessment of
                taxes in all Emirates of the UAE. The relevant regulatory
                authorities will check your excise tax registration, returns,
                and filing in accordance with the tax period. Proper handling of
                excisable goods will exempt you from FTA non-compliance
                penalties.

                The ultimate objective of excise compliance
              </h1>
              <p className="">
                The main objective of excise duty compliance in the UAE is to
                protect companies’ accounts from heavy fines from the FTA. The
                administering tax authority will subsequently impose penalties
                on a company that fails to comply with the excise duty laws.
                They are imposed for incorrect registration, late filing of
                declarations, submission of invalid documents, or other
                information. The FTA is very strict in imposing penalties for
                non-compliance with excise duty rules. It is therefore advisable
                to hire professional consultants to provide excise duty services
                in the UAE and to ensure that all necessary compliance
                obligations are met.

                Why is it difficult for companies to comply in the UAE?
              </h1>
              <p className="">
                The tax authority in the UAE is constantly changing laws and
                regulations to attract investors to the country. The UAE
                government has done this in order to beat the global business
                competition. But this makes it harder for companies to comply
                with tax rules. Businesses are confused about the right time to
                register, whether they are over the threshold, how often they
                need to file an excise tax return in the UAE, and so on. This is
                because yesterday’s excise duty compliance may not be the same
                as today’s. For a successful excise duty application, always set
                FTA guidelines.

                Excise compliance in the UAE is a very important process that
                has undergone significant changes to save the country from the
                harmful effects of excisable goods. When managing your excise
                compliance, our tax consultants highlight a number of factors.

              <p>
                Excise duty valuation is the process of determining the value of
                excisable goods. It involves calculating the amount of excise
                duty according to the excise duty rate. Valuation is important
                because even a small error in the calculation can lead to the
                loss of tax records. BestaxCA’s expert excise consultants
                efficiently process and calculate the amount of tax payable to
                the government, leaving no room for error. We provide targeted
                assistance to individuals and businesses to help them comply
                with excise duty requirements.

              </h1>

              <p>
                Excise tax returns must be filed accurately with the FTA for
                each tax period. A registered legal person who fails to submit
                an excise duty return on time is not only liable to fines, but
                also to a loss of reputation. Our tax advisors ensure that your
                returns are filed correctly and by the due date. We file your
                statutory declarations together with your returns to ensure
                transparency of excise goods.

              <p>
                Excise duty records must be up-to-date and accurate to avoid FTA
                penalties. Poor excise duty records can make it difficult for
                registered businesses to register for excise duty, submit
                declarations and obtain refunds. If you find yourself in a
                similar situation, you can consult our tax experts in Dubai. Our

                The accuracy and validation of your excise documents and other
                related information are paramount to excise compliance. A small
                error or omission of information can lead to fines and

                all your supporting documents in accordance with FTA guidelines,
