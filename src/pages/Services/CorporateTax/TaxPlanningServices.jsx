                UAE business sectors are abuzz with the noise of the Corporate
                tax regime that was recently introduced by the Federal
                Government, stating that along with VAT all businesses will have
                to adhere to Corporate Tax, with some exceptions as well. To be
                exact, the tax rates are 0% for taxable income up to AED 375,000
                and 9% for taxable income above AED 375,000. Also known as
                “Business Profit tax” as it is levied on the net profit or loss
                of business, this regime has cemented UAE’s position
                internationally by complying with global standards yet at the
                same time has maintained its position as the most attractive
                investment opportunity for international investors.
                <br />
                <br />
                The regime is becoming effective for financial years starting on
                or after June 1, 2023, with a documentation basis the same as
                being recorded for VAT. With the introduction of Corporate Tax,
                it has become the utmost need for every eligible business to
                have corporate tax planning in place to prepare and comply with
                the obligations. The best way to go around the need of the hour
                would be to consult with providers of tax services as they’ll
                have expertise that goes into tax planning and will mold it
                tailored to what your business needs.

                Tax Planning Significance
              </h1>
              <p>
                Tax planning consists of getting an analysis done of the
                financial situation or structure that a business has in place to
                confirm that all the working aspects will eventually result in
                the lowest tax payments possible. Your tax planning will be
                considered efficient if its consequences will lead to lower tax
                payments than the previous payments. Every business constructing
                a financial plan needs to have tax planning as part of it for
                reaching integral results. As per federal authorities, there are
                certain tax liabilities that are obligatory for individuals and
                businesses, but it is the expertise of tax consultancy providing
                tax services to minimize the payable income while adhering to
                legal and accepted measures.

                Planning Corporate Tax
              </h1>
              <p>
                UAE Corporate tax will be applied to all commercial and business
                activities, other than the exemptions mentioned by FTA, but the
                overall vast majority of the corporate sector will be affected
                by the regime. Ideally, a Corporate tax regime has been put in
                place to lower the compliance cost of business and compete
                globally, the true essence of which can be obtained if
                businesses focus on fruitful corporate tax planning. The taxable
                entities are responsible for ensuring that tax returns and
                supporting documents submitted are authentic, complete, and in
                compliance with the UAE Corporate Tax Law. This can be achieved
                only if functional corporate tax planning has been done before
                time by the entities to avoid any discrepancy.

              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                In order to do all of the above-mentioned tax services, it is
                vital for service providers to have an elaborate understanding
                of the business they’re working with, only then it will be
                possible to deliver tax planning that is custom-tailored to the
                requirements of the business. It should also be noted that a
                vital part of tax planning should be staying informed of the new
                legislation and having a keen understanding of them before they
                cause a negative impact on business operations. This can be best
                achieved when tax services are provided from a global approach
                rather than just focusing on the limited legislation information
                at hand. Tax planning will turn out fruitful only if worldwide
                expertise is extended that meets the expectations and custom
                situations faced by businesses belonging to their respective
                industries.

                One of the major fragments of tax planning is tax return filing,

                regime. Other than ensuring your tax services are in compliance
                with the standard regulations and are being dealt with
                efficiently, a business needs assistance with filing tax
                returns, which in the case of corporate tax will be done
                annually. At this stage tax planning will include guidance on
                tax calculations, supplying tax planning advice along with
                preparation of relevant information documented and submitted as
                required by the law. Further understanding of tax planning in
