                Many companies in the UAE have historically had zero income tax
                on profits. However, this is about to change as the Ministry of
                Finance (MoF) announced on 31 January 2022 that a federal
                corporate income tax (CIT) will be introduced in the UAE. The
                CIT regime is expected to apply to fiscal years beginning on or
                after 1 June 2023.
                <br />
                <br />
                The move is justified by the UAE’s desire to comply with
                international tax standards, following similar measures in
                neighboring Gulf countries, while reducing the compliance burden
                for UAE companies and protecting small businesses and start-ups.
                The UAE, where the main business hub of Dubai is located, will
                continue to have one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the
                world, but this move will allow the country to diversify its
                income from hydrocarbons.
                <br />
                <br />
                Younis Haji Al Khoori, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of
                Finance, said that “the certainty of a competitive and
                best-in-class corporate tax regime, combined with the UAE’s
                extensive network of double tax treaties, will strengthen the
                UAE’s position as a leading global business and investment hub”.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Ministry of Finance has announced the following key features
                of the proposed corporate tax regime
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h1 className="text-primary text-3xl my-10">
                DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE
              </h1>
              <p>
                The CIT regime is expected to apply to financial years beginning
                on or after 1 June 2023.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h1 className="text-primary text-3xl my-10">SCOPE </h1>
              <p>
                The proposed tax regime is expected to apply to all business
                (i.e. commercial, industrial, and professional) activities in
                the UAE, with the exception of natural resource extraction,
                which is already (and will continue to be) taxed at the Emirati
                level.
                <br />
                <br />
                The taxation regime will also apply to natural persons to the
                extent that they hold (or are legally required to hold) a
                business license or permit to carry on commercial, industrial,
                and/or professional activities in the UAE. It also applies to
                income earned by freelancers in respect of activities carried
                out under a freelance license or permit.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Ministry of Finance has announced that the proposed federal
                tax regime will also apply to banking operations in the UAE
                (although foreign bank branches are already taxed at the Emirati
                level).
                <br />
                <br />
                It was also announced that the corporate tax incentives
                currently offered to free zone companies will be maintained, as
                long as the free zone company meets all applicable regulatory
                requirements and does not carry on business in the UAE mainland.
                This may affect many companies currently operating in both the
                UAE mainland and the free zones under the dual licensing scheme.
                <br />
                <br />
                However, free zone companies will still have to comply with
                certain obligations under the UBI regime, including the
                requirement to register and file a UBI return. Further details
                on the exemptions and exceptions to the corporate tax will be
                provided by the Ministry of Finance in due course.

                Three different corporate tax rates are proposed:

                0% rate on taxable income up to AED 375,000 (approximately USD

                <br />A different rate (yet to be announced) for large
                multinational companies with consolidated global revenues
                exceeding €750 million (approximately AED 3.15 billion), under
                the second pillar of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting

                  Dividends and capital gains derived by a UAE company from its

                <li>

                <b>Foreign tax credits.</b> Foreign tax paid on UAE taxable
                income will be allowed as a credit against UAE tax payable. In
                this context, it should be noted that the UAE has entered into
                more than 130 double tax treaties which will further facilitate
                the proper functioning of the tax system in relation to
                cross-border trade and ownership, both before and after the
                introduction of the UAE CIT.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Losses.</b>The CIR regime will allow companies to use losses
                incurred to reduce taxable income in future financial periods.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Tax brackets.</b>Groups of UAE companies will be able to
                elect to form a tax group and be treated as a single company for
                tax purposes, subject to certain conditions to be specified in
                the UAE CIT Law. A UAE tax group will be able to file a single
                tax return for the entire group.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Transfer Pricing.</b>UAE companies will also have to comply
                with transfer pricing rules and documentation requirements based
                on the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
                <br />
                <br />
                The relevant corporate income tax legislation is still under
                development and has not yet been published. Although the regime
                that will ultimately come into force may differ from the
                announcement by the Ministry of Finance, companies operating in
                the UAE should consider the potential impact of the announced
                regime and prepare for the forthcoming changes in the
                legislation.
